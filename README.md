# Learn with Blook by Denise and Eudora

## Website description

‘Learn with Blook’ is a safe online educational website for children ages 6 and up! Blook is a little monster that will guide the child through our website. The website aims to help children develop ICT skills in a fun and interactive way. One of the games is a touch-typing game called ‘Touch Typer Quest’. The game will consist of many levels and whenever a child gets a 3-star rating, they will receive a badge to congratulate them for their amazing achievement.
There are several benefits to teaching children to touch type at a young age. One of the main benefits of touch typing is that it can improve their overall typing speed and accuracy, making them more efficient at completing schoolwork and other tasks requiring typing. It can give children a valuable skill that will serve them well throughout their lives, as typing is an essential skill in today's digital world. <br>
